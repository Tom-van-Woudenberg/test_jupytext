# Text and code

```{custom_download_link} text_and_code.md
:text: "myst:md"
```

This page has both a ipynb and md version. It's referenced to by the toc with a `.ipynb`. A download link replacer thing is added with:

````
```{custom_download_link} text_and_code.md
:text: "myst:md"
```
````

It can be downloaded as `.ipynb` or `myst:md`

Can it be edited from the GitHub online editor too? And now?

I changed something, now again, again!

```{code-cell} ipython3
print('hello world 4')
```
